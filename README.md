## Tree after Rzepakowski & Jorszewicz
The decision tree is based on the one proposed by Piotr Rzepakowski & Szymon Jaroszewicz ["Decision trees for uplift modeling with single
and multiple treatments"](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81899141.pdf)
The implementation for that tree can be found in "DecisionTreeImplementation.R"

The method to build a single tree is called "create_node".

The method to build a forest is called "build_forest".

## Evaluation Metrics

The implementation of the evaluation metrics can be found in "Evaluation Methods.R"
